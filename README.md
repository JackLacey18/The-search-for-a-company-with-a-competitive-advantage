Based on the book, Warren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements: The Search for the Company with a Durable Competitive Advantage. I have tried to log the various metrics Warren Buffett uses to search for a great company that will make him rich.

The notebook takes a stock ticker and parses financial statements to provide a tabular view of the various metrics Buffett uses to make a decision about whether to invest in a company.
